She isn't coming yet, Toto.  
Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she?  
Come on - we'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.  
Come on, Toto.
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!
Aunt Em!
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --

Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --

Dorothy, please! We're trying to count!
Fifty-eight--
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
UNCLE HENRY  
Don't bother us now, honey -- this old incubator's gone bad, and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

DOROTHY  
Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh, but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the back with a rake just because...
she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat every day.

AUNT EM
Seventy -- Dorothy, please!

DOROTHY
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat, anyway.
says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --

AUNT EM
Dorothy!     Dorothy!   We're busy!

DOROTHY
Oh -- all right.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.

I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
AUNT EM Oh, I hope we got them in time.

UNCLE HENRY Yes.

MLS -- Zeke -- Hunk and Hickory working on wagon -- Hickory  
and Zeke lowering bed of wagon into place --
How's she coming?
Ow! You got my finger!
Well, why don't you get your finger out of the way!
Come on - come on - over this way.

Okay.
There you are.

HUNK  
Right on my finger!

ZEKE  
It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

DOROTHY  
Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss
Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old cat --

ZEKE  
Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

HUNK  
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't have any brains at all.
I have so got brains.
HUNK  
Well, why don't you use them? When you  
come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's  
place. Then Toto won't get in her  
garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  
See?

DOROTHY  
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.

Hickory - straightens up - reacts

Dorothy comes forward

Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted.  
Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.

Now look, here's something that really  
has a heart. This is the best invention I  
ever invented.
This?

HICKORY Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now.

HICKORY Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents
Oh, stop it!

Oh!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.

Hickory!

Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Get in there before I make a dime bank out of you!  
Listen, kid, are you going to let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?
Zeke (CONT'D) She ain't nothing to be afraid of. Have a little courage, that's all.

Dorothy Walking along railing between pig pens --
I'm not afraid of her.

ZEKE  
Then the next time she squawks, walk  
right up to her and spit in her eye.  
That's what I'd do!
Oh!

Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke!

Get me out of here! Help!

Are you all right, Dorothy?

Yes, I'm all right. Oh -- I fell in and -

Aunt Em enters with plate of crullers -- 

Aunt Em and Hickory -- they speak --

Hunk and Hickory each take cruller -- 

Aunt Em comes forward to Zeke and Dorothy -- she speaks to Zeke --

Dorothy takes cruller -- 

Aunt Em runs to b.g. --
DOROTHY (CONT'D)  
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!

HUNK  
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white

AUNT EM
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done? I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --

AUNT EM  
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!

HICKORY  
All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in
this town, and --
AUNT EM  
Well, don't start posing for it now.  
Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.

HUNK  
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
Just fried.

HICKORY
Thanks.

HUNK
Swell.

ZEKE
You see, Dorothy toppled in with the big
It's no place for Dorothy about a pig sty! Now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!

Yes'am.
DOROTHY  
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? She said she was gonna --

AUNT EM  
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy  
No --

Aunt Em  
Now, you just help us out today, and find  
yourself a place where you won't get into  
any trouble.

Dorothy  
No --
DOROTHY  
Some place where there isn't any trouble.
Toto eats it

Dorothy speaks as she walks forward
Do you suppose there is such a place,
Toto? There must be. It's not a place
you can get to by a boat or a train.

Dorothy leans against haystack
Do you suppose there is such a place,
Toto? There must be. It's not a place
you can get to by a boat or a train.

Dorothy then walks over near rake
Do you suppose there is such a place,
Toto? There must be. It's not a place
you can get to by a boat or a train.

Dorothy sings
Do you suppose there is such a place,
Toto? There must be. It's not a place
you can get to by a boat or a train.
It's far, far away -- behind the moon --
beyond the rain --

DOROTHY (CONT'D)
(sings)
Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high,
There's a land that I heard of once in a
lullaby.

Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue, And the dreams
that you dare to dream really do....  
DOROTHY o.s. (sings) ...come true....  
DOROTHY (CONT'D) (sings) ...Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake
up where the clouds are far behind me.

Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
Away above the chimney  
tops, That's where you'll find me.  

Somewhere, over the  
rainbow, bluebirds fly.  
Birds fly over the rainbow,  
Why then - oh, why can't I?  
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh, why can't I?
Mr. Gale!

Howdy, Miss Gulch.

I want to see you and your wife right away....

MISS GULCH (CONT'D) about Dorothy.

UNCLE HENRY  
Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?
What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!

You mean she bit you?

No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

NO!
Dorothy screams at Miss Gulch  
Miss Gulch tries to take Toto away from Dorothy  
Uncle Henry takes Toto  
Uncle Henry puts him into basket
That dog's a menace to the community.  
I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.  
Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?
Of course we won't. Will we, Em?
DOROTHY  
Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn't mean to. He  
didn't know he was doing anything wrong.  
I'm the one that ought to be punished. I  
let him go in her garden. You can send  
me to bed without supper --  

MISS GULCH  
If you don't hand over that dog, I'll  
bring a damage suit that'll take your
whole farm! There's a law protecting folks against dogs that bite!

AUNT EM
How would it be if she keeps him tied up?
He's really gentle -- with gentle people, that is.

MISS GULCH
Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide.
Here's his order allowing me to take him. Unless you want to go against the law.

UNCLE HENRY  
Uhh--yeah--

AUNT EM  
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
NOW YOU'RE SEEING REASON.

NO --

HERE'S WHAT I'M TAKING HIM IN -- SO HE CAN'T ATTACK ME AGAIN.
Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him!

You go away, you....!

Oooh, I'll bite you myself!

Dorothy!
You wicked old witch!

Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!

Don't let her take him -- please!
Here! I've got an order! Let me have...

Stop her!

Put him in the basket, Henry.
The idea!

Oh, don't, Uncle Henry.  
Oh, Toto!
Don't...

Uncle Henry sits in chair at right f.g. -- grins --

AUNT EM  
Almira Gulch, just because you own half  
the county doesn't mean you have the  
power to run the rest of us! For twenty-  
three years, I've been dying to tell you  
what I thought of you! And now -- well,  
being a Christian woman, I can't say it!
Toto sticks his head out -- looks about -- then jumps out -- 

Toto jumps to ground --
Toto, darling! Oh, I got you back!  
You

No, that's not right. I --  
you're -- you're going on a visit.  
No, I'm wrong. That's...  
You're -- running away.  

DOROTHY  
How did you guess?  

PROFESSOR  
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he
knows! Now, why are you running away?
DOROTHY  
Why --

PROFESSOR  
No, no -- now don't tell me. They -- they don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
DOROTHY  
Why, it's just like you could read what  
was inside of me.

PROFESSOR  
Yes --
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?

Well, we -- uh -- 

Oh, Toto, that's not.... 

Dorothy o.s. 

...polite! We haven't been asked yet.
He's perfectly welcome. As one dog to  
another, huh?  

Here now -- let's see where were we?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?

Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh --
DOROTHY
Nobody cares about me at home. They  
wouldn't even miss me.

PROFESSOR
Aw, come, come, come --  

DOROTHY
No, they won't - honestly.
PROFESSOR  
Oh --

DOROTHY  
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing -

Yes, well, I -- I never do anything
without consulting my crystal first.

MLS -- Professor rises -- CAMERA PANS as he and Dorothy cross
to right to wagon --

right in there.

Professor moves chair up for Dorothy --
then lights candles -- sits down -- puts on turban -- speaks to Dorothy -- she closes her eyes -- he takes her basket -- looks thru it -- takes out a photograph --
That's right. Here -- sit right down here.  
That's it. Ha ha!  
This -- this is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal used by the Priests of Isis and Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs of Egypt -- in which Cleopatra first saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony, and -- and so on -- and so on.  
Now, you -- you'd better close your eyes.
my child, for a moment -- in order to be better in tune with the infinite. We -- we can't do these things without....
reaching out into the.... 

infinite. Yes.

he puts photograph on chair --
Dorothy opens her eyes --
That's -- that's all right. Now you can open them. We'll gaze into the crystal.  
Ahh -- what's this I see? A house -- with a picket fence....
and a barn -- with a weather vane and  
a -- of a -- of a running horse.

No - it's - it's - a crowing rooster.
That's our farm!

Oh -- yes.
Yes, there's -- there's a woman --  
she's.... INSERT -- CU of the photograph -  

MCS -- Dorothy and Professor -- he puts the photograph away  
again -- looks into crystal --
she's wearing a polka-dot dress
Yes...That's Aunt Em.

Her -- her name is Emily.
That's right. What's she doing?

Why, she's crying.
Oh --

PROFESSOR  
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.

DOROTHY  
Me?
Well, it's -- it's someone she loves very much. Someone she's been very kind to. Someone she's taken care of in sickness.

DOROTHY
Camera shooting past Professor --
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.

PROFESSOR
Uh-huh.

DOROTHY
What's she doing now?
Dorothy -
PROFESSOR  
Well, she's - she's going into a little bed.... CU - Dorothy - Camera shooting past Professor -

Has it poppies on the wall.... MCU -

Eh -- she's -- What's this? Why, she's --
she's putting her hand on her heart --
she's -- she's dropping down on the....
DOROTHY  
Oh, no -- no!

PROFESSOR (CONT'D)  
...bed.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.

Oh, you....

Dorothy and Professor -- Dorothy jumps up -- picks up her basket -- goes to b.g. --

DOROTHY (CONT'D)
you don't suppose she could really be  
sick, do you?  

Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!  

PROFESSOR But -- what's this? I thought you were  
going along with me.  

DOROTHY Oh, no, no, I have to get to her
right...
Dorothy (CONT'D) ...away! Come on, Toto! Oh, what'll I do?

Dorothy (CONT'D) If we go home, they'll send you to the Sheriff. And if we don't, Aunt Em may --
well, she may die!  
I know what I'll do -  
I'll give you to Hunk. He'll watch out  
for you. But we've got to hurry.  
Goodbye, Professor Marvel -- and thanks a lot!  

MLS -- Professor comes out of wagon -- CAMERA PANS him left

Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?

Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
GLINDA  
Oh! Well....
GLINDA o.s. ...is that the Witch?

DOROTHY
Who, Toto?

DOROTHY (CONT'D)
Toto's my dog.

GLINDA  
Well, I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
GLINDA o.s. ...that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East.

Oh, but I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly. What was that?
The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

national heroine, my dear.  
It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her.  
It's all right now -- you may all come out.
Come out, come out, wherever you are

DOROTHY  
When she fell out of Kansas, a miracle occurred.  

MCS – Glinda and Dorothy standing by the pond – Dorothy sings – Munchkins in b.g. –
It really was no miracle.  
What happened  
was just this:

The wind began to switch -- the house to pitch

the hinges started to unhitch.  

Just then, the witch -- to  
satisfy an itch --  
Went flying on her broomstick thumbing for...

You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!

GLINDA: I'm sorry, Dorothy, but only the Wizard of Oz can help you.

GLINDA: (kisses Dorothy on the forehead) There now, you'll be just fine.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur! I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

DOROTHY Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came.
GLINDA  
No -- that's true. The only person who  
might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!

DOROTHY  
The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.

Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember,
never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.

DOROTHY
But, how do I start for Emerald City?

GLINDA
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the
But -- what happens if I --- 

Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Dorothy look up o.s., open-mouthed with astonishment  
CAMERA PANS down to her feet as she starts to follow the Yellow Brick Road  
CAMERA PULLS back slightly as she walks around it  
the Mayor steps in, speaks to her  
other Munchkins speak

Dorothy comes forward down the Munchkin-lined Yellow Brick Road -- she dances, skips along -- CAMERA BOOMS rapidly back along the road ahead of her -- Munchkins entered lined up along the road -- all greet her, then follow her down the road -- the Five Fiddlers sing as they head the procession --
Dorothy passes through the gates of Munchkinland and exits to f.g.

FIDDLERS (sing)
...Yellow Brick

Follow the Yellow Brick Road. You're off to see the Wizard  
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  
You'll find he is a whiz of a Wiz  
If ever a Wiz there was.  
If ever oh ever a Wiz there was
Dorothy dances down the Yellow Brick Road to the b.g. -- camera shooting over the heads of the Munchkins in the f.g. as they sing to her -- she turns, waves to them -- they wave back and Dorothy continues on down the road as the Munchkins cheer --
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz!
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?  
Follow the  
Yellow....?
Now which way do we go?

Dorothy whirls about and looks at him--
SCARECROW  
That way is a very nice way.

DOROTHY  
Who said that?
DOROTHY  
Don't be silly, Toto.  

Scarecrows....
DOROTHY  
...don't talk.

SCARECROW  
It's pleasant down that way, too.

CU -- Dorothy reacts, watches the Scarecrow o.s. -- speaks to Toto -- looks up as the Scarecrow speaks o.s.
That's funny. Wasn't he pointing the other way?

Of course, people do.... 

Scarecrow crosses his arms and points in both directions --

go both ways!
DOROTHY  
Why...
DOROTHY  
...you did say something, didn't you?

CS-  
The Scarecrow shakes his head, then nods.
DOROTHY  
Are you doing that on purpose, or can't  
you make up your mind?
That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind. I haven't got a brain -- only straw.

How can you talk if you haven't got a....
DOROTHY  
o.s.  
But some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, don't they?
DOROTHY  
Well, we haven't really met properly,  

DOROTHY  
Yes, I guess you're right.
SCARECROW  
Why, no.
DOROTHY  
How do you do?  

SCARECROW  
(nods)
SCARECROW  
How do you do?

DOROTHY  
Very well, thank you.

SCARECROW  
Complains about his position --
SCARECROW  
Oh, I'm not feeling at all well. You see, it's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back.

DOROTHY  
Oh, dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?
Down?  
No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --  

Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.

Well, oh, dear -- I don't quite see....
DOROTHY o.s. ...how I can --  

SCARECROW  
Of course, I'm not bright about doing  
things, but if you'll just...
CS -- Dorothy starts to follow the Scarecrow's directions --

SCARECROW o.s. ...bend the nail down in the back, maybe I'll slip off and...

DOROTHY Oh....
DOROTHY  
...yes.

SCARECROW  
Ohhhh --
Ohh!

SCARECROW  
Whhhooops!  
Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh -- does it hurt you?

Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.

Ohhh --
Dorothy screams

Scarecrow whirls about and falls over the cornfield fence
DOROTHY  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Ohhh!
SCARECROW  
Did I scare you?

DOROTHY  
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt  
yourself.
But I didn't scare you?

No -- of course not.
I didn't think so.

Boo! Scat!
Boo! You see, I can't even scare a crow!
They come from miles.... around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face!
Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got  
a brain.

Well, what would you do with a brain if
you had one?
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could --

(sings)  
I could while away the hours, Conferrin'
with the flowers, Consultin' with the
rain. And my head I'd be scratchin' While
my thoughts were busy hatchin'
Dorothy holds the Scarecrow as she sings -- shot favoring Dorothy --
DOROTHY (sings)
With the thoughts you'll be thinkin'  
You could be another Lincoln  
If you only had
Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near
I could think of things I never thunk before,

And then I'd sit -- and think some more.

I would not be just a nuffin'
My head all full of stuffin',
My heart all full of pain.

I would dance and be merry...

(sings)
Gosh, it would be awful pleasin' To reason out the reason For things I can't explain. Then perhaps I'll deserve you, And be even worthy erv you If I only had a brain.

Dorothy kneeling by the Scarecrow -- she speaks as she helps him put back some of the straw --
they react -- Scarecrow half-rises --

DOROTHY  
Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!

SCARECROW  
They would?
DOROTHY Um-hmm.

SCARECROW Where's Kansas?

DOROTHY That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz
SCARECROW  
You're going to see a Wizard?

DOROTHY  
Um-hmm.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say. But even if he didn't,
you'd be no worse off than you are now.

Yes -- that's true.

But maybe you'd better not. I've got
witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.

SCARECROW  
Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch!

I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.

DOROTHY  
I don't blame you for that.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for
the chance of getting some brains. Look -

I won't be any trouble, because I don't
eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage
things, because I can't think. Won't you
take me with you?
Why, of course I will!
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!

DOROTHY Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.

SCARECROW Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.

Dorothy reacts as she sees the apple orchard at right - she goes up to one of
Oh -- apples -- Oh look!   Oh.   Oh ---  

DOROTHY  
Oh -- apples -- Oh look!   Oh.   Oh ---  

DOROTHY  
reacts as the tree takes the apple back and slaps Dorothy's hand --
Ouch!

TREE  
What do you think you're doing?

DOROTHY  
(o.s.)  
Ouch!
We've been walking a long ways and I was hungry and -- Did you say....  
She....
FIRST TREE ...was hungry! Well, how would you like to have someone come along and pick
something off of you?

MCU -- Scarecrow and Dorothy react, speak as they look o.s. at the tree --

DOROTHY Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  
Hmm!  
MCU -- First tree reacts, and speaks --  

FIRST TREE  
What do you mean - she doesn't want any of those apples? Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be?  
MCU -- Scarecrow and Dorothy --
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green...

Oh....
you...

Go -- Go!
Help -- let me out.  
I'll give  
you little green....  

Dorothy -- the Scarecrow backs in from left f.g. --
gestures at the Trees o.s. -- speaks -- then makes faces at  
the trees --  
TREE o.s. ...worms.
SCARECROW  
I'll show you how to get apples.

o.s.
You can't....  
MS -- The First tree winds up, throws apples  
o.s. to f.g. --  

TREE  
...do that to me! I'll....  

Scarecrow and Dorothy react as the apples begin to hit them -- the Scarecrow falls back to the road --  
TREE o.s.  
...show you!
The Scarecrow rises, dodges about

TREES  
You can't do that!  
You can't do that!  
Hey!

CS -- First Tree laughs as it throws apples to f.g.

SCARECROW o.s. Hooray!
Scarecrow picks them up --

SCARECROW  
Hooray! I guess that did it!  
Help yourself.

DOROTHY  
Oh --
Why, it's a man! A man made out of tin!
SCARECROW  
What?

DOROTHY  
Yes. Oh -- look --

TIN MAN  
Oil can.....Oil can....
DOROTHY  
Did you say something?
Oil can....

Oil can what?

Oh -- oh, here it is!
Where do you want to be oiled first?

My mouth -- my mouth!

He said his mouth.
DOROTHY  
Here -- here --  

SCARECROW  
The other side....

DOROTHY  
Yes --- there.
Mm.....mm...mm....
TIN MAN  
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I  
can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please  
-- oil my elbows.

DOROTHY  
Oh...
Dorothy lowers the right arm of the Tin Man so that it hangs naturally  
Scarecrow busy with the oil can  
the Tin Man begins his story
Oh --

Oh, did that hurt?

No -- it feels wonderful.   
I've held that axe up for ages. Oh ---
Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?

Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
and right in the middle of a chop,  
I...I rusted solid. And I've been that
DOROTHY  
Well, you're perfect now.

TIN MAN  
My...my neck. My...my neck. Perfect?

Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm  
perfect. Go ahead -- bang on it!
DOROTHY  
Oh --!

SCARECROW  
Beautiful! What an echo!

TIN MAN  
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give  
me a heart.
DOROTHY AND SCARECROW

No heart?

TIN MAN  
No heart.
Oh --

All hollow. Oh --
When a man's an empty kettle, He should  
be on his mettle. And yet I'm torn apart.  
Just because I'm presumin' That I could  
be kind-a human, If I only had a heart.
I'd be tender -- I'd be gentle  
And awful  
sentimental  
Regarding Love and Art I'd be  
friends with sparrows...
TIN MAN  
(sings)  
...And the boy who shoots the arrows  
If I only had a heart.  
Picture me....a balcony....

SNOW WHITE'S VOICE  
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
I hear a beat....how sweet!

Just to register emotion Jealousy -- Devotion --

And really feel the part, I could stay young and chipper,

And I'd lock it with a zipper,

If I only had a heart...!

DOROTHY

DOROTHY

DOROTHY  
-- grabs the Tin Man's hand --
Oh --

DOROTHY reacts, speaks with him --

DOROTHY oils the Tin Man some more, then asks him to go to the Emerald City, too --

they rise to their feet as CAMERA PANS up to the right to the Witch standing on the roof of Tin Man's cottage --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?

I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

Oh, dear -- That was wonderful! You know  
-- we were just wondering why you  
couldn't come to Emerald City with us to
ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.

TIN MAN  
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
SCARECROW  
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.

DOROTHY  
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
TIN MAN  
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?

DOROTHY  
Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.

(Witch laughs offstage)
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --

You call that long?
Why, you've just begun!

you, Forgotten about me,...

Helping the little lady along, are you,
my fine gentlemen?
Or I'll stuff a mattress with you!

Tin Man points to the trembling Scarecrow -- then the Tin Man reacts -- points
And you! I'll use you for a bee-hive!  
(laughs)  

Here, Scarecrow! Want to play ball?
And as for you, my little....
WITCH o.s. ...Dorothy, I wish....  
WITCH o.s. ...you luck with the Wizard of Oz. And a....  
WITCH o.s. ...happy journey back to Kansas!

Tin Man reacts to buzzing sound
SCARECROW  
I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get  
safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a  
brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me!  

TIN MAN  
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I  
get a heart or not. Bee-hive -- bah!  
Let her try and make a bee-hive out of...
Hmm? What's that?

Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?

I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!

Oh!
Oh - I'll get it!

Oh! Oh!

Oh --
TIN MAN
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!

DOROTHY
Oh-oh-
DOROTHY  
Oh, there....

TIN MAN  
It's only a man without a head who could do a thing like that. Poor little bee.
DOROTHY  
As a matter of fact, that's just an old drone bee, and it would have died.

CU - Tin Man looks o.s. - DOROTHY o.s.
TIN MAN  
Yes?

DOROTHY o.s.  
You put it out of its misery.
TIN MAN  
Oh.

DOROTHY o.s. It's....
DOROTHY
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I  
don't think you two ought to come with me  
because you'll get into trouble.

SCARECROW
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand  
by and let her get away with fireballs  
and bees, do you?
TIN MAN  
No, sir!

SCARECROW  
No, sir!

DOROTHY  
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had! And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time. But I
couldn't have, could I?

I don't see how. You weren't around when  
I was stuffed and sewn together, were  
you?

And I was standing over there rusting for  
the longest time.
Still, I wish I could remember.  
But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  
We know each other now, don't we?  

That's right.  

Still, I wish I could remember.  
But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  
We know each other now, don't we?
We do.

Dorothy frightened -- speaks --
I don't like this forest! It's -- it's dark and creepy!

Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?

We might.

Oh --
Animals that -- that eat straw?

Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.

Dorothy reacts --
Lions?
And tigers?

And bears.
Lions and tigers and bears!

Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!

Lions and tigers and bears!

Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

(screams)
And bears!

What sort of an animal is that?

It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
D-d-d-don't be fr-fr-frightened. I - I'll

CU -- Lion growling --  

CS -- Scarecrow
LION Put 'em up! Put 'em....
LION  
Which one of you first? I'll fight you both together if you want!

I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back.

I'll fight you standing on one foot.
I'll fight you with my eyes closed. Oh --  
pulling an axe on me, eh?
Sneaking up on me, eh?  
Why!  
(snarls)
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!

Afraid, huh?

MCS -- Lion and Tin Man -- Lion speaks and laughs
Scarecrow  
Get off me!
Now that's getting personal, Lion.  
Yes -- get up and teach him a lesson.
SCARECROW  
Well -- what's -- wrong with you teaching  
him?  

TIN MAN  
Well -- well --, I hardly know him.  

LION  
snarls -- speaks--  

TIN MAN  
CS -- Toto barking -- CU -- Lion snarls --
Well, I'll get you, anyway, Pee-Wee.
Dorothy slaps his hand
Shame on you!

What — what did you do that for?  
I didn't bite him.
DOROTHY  
It's bad enough picking on a straw man,  
but when you go around picking on poor...  

LION  
(sobbing)  
...me...
LION  
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me,  
did you? Is my nose bleeding?

DOROTHY  
Well, of course not. My goodness, what a  
fuss you're making. Well, naturally,  
when you go around picking on things
You're right -- I am a coward.

LION -- Camera shooting past Dorothy -- Lion crying -- speaks --
I haven't any courage at all. I even scare myself. Look at the circles under my eyes.
I haven't slept in weeks.

Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.

Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?

I don't see why not. Why don't you come
along with us? We're on our way to see  
the Wizard now. To get him a heart.  

And him a brain.  

I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Well, wouldn't you feel degraded to be
seen in the company of a cowardly lion?
I would.

DOROTHY
No, of course not.

Gee, that's -- that's awfully nice of you. My life....
CAMERA TRUCKS with them --

LION  
...has been simply unbearable.

DOROTHY  
Oh.

(CONTINUED)
LION  
(sings)  
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy  
When you're born to be a sissy, Without the  
vim and verve. But I could show my  
prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If
I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's  
no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A  
fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a  
blizzard --  

TIN MAN  
(sings)  
I'd be gentle as a lizard --  

SCARECROW
I'd be clever as a gizzard --

If the Wizard is a Wizard who will serve.
SCARECROW  
(sings)  
Then I'm sure to get a brain --  

TIN MAN  
(sings)  
A heart --  

DOROTHY  
(sings)
The nerve.

Dorothy and Lion sing as they dance forward along brick road -- CAMERA TRUCKS ahead --

to the eye -- and soothing to the smell!
(laughs)
Poppies! Poppies! Poppies!
There's Emerald....
DOROTHY
City! Oh, we're almost there at last!
At last!
It's beautiful, isn't it? Just like I knew it would be. He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
LION  
Well, come on, then. What are we waiting for?

SCARECROW  
Nothing! Let's hurry!
Yes -- let's run!

Yes.
Come on -- come on --

Oh! Oh, come on, come on!

TIN MAN  
Look -- you can see it here. It's wonderful!
Emerald City!
Oh -- Oh -- what's happening?  
What is it?
I can't run anymore. I'm so.... sleepy.

Here -- give us your hands, and we'll pull you....
Oh, no -- please. I have to rest for  
just a minute. Toto!

Where's Toto --
Dorothy lies down among the poppies --

SCARECROW  
Oh, you can't rest now -- we're nearly there!

MCU - Lion yawns and speaks -

LION  
What did she -- do that for?
SCARECROW  
Hey, Dorothy!

Hi!

I'm frightened, I'm frightened, Auntie Em -- I'm frightened!
Dorothy -- Dorothy -- where are you?
It's me -- it's Auntie Em. We're trying
to find you. Where are you?

I -- I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em. I'm
locked up in the Witch's castle....and
I'm trying to get home to you, Auntie Em!
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!

Auntie Em -- Auntie Em -- come back!
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
You put up a great fight, Lion.

Yeah --

I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Hah. I - I must have bitten you a couple of times.
SCARECROW  
Come on -- I've got another idea.

LION  
Do -- do you think it'll be polite --
dropping in like this?

TIN MAN  
Come on -- come on.

It's us!
Yes, it's me! She's locked me in!

Oh, I knew you'd get here in time!

The Lion speaks to Scarecrow and Tin Man as they move excitedly about --
Listen, fellows. It's her. We gotta get her out! Open this door!

Open the door! Open....

Don't push!

the Lion speaks -
Go ahead - do something! Roar! Roar!
What good'll it do us?
That's right. Don't hurt them right away.

We'll let...

The Winkies growl as they shove out their spears

MCS- The Scarecrow seizes the Tin Man's axe and chops the candelabra rope with it.
Oh!
Seize....

Stop them! Stop them!
It's no use trying the doors again!  
Which room is it?

WITCH  
Well -- ring around the rosy -- a pocket  
full of spears! Thought you'd be pretty  
foxy, didn't you? Well, I'm going to  
start in on you right here - one after  
the other!
And the last to go will see the first three go before her! And your mangy little dog, too!  
The Four react with fear.  
The broomstick catches fire.  
The Witch lowers it and speaks:  
And the last to go will see the first three go before her!
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

No -- No -- No -- No!
OHH!

Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!  
I'm burning! Help! Help! Help!

The Witch screams as the water hits her

The Lion, Tin Man, Dorothy and Scarecrow watch the Witch as she screams and melts away

The Witch curses as she disappears
Ohhh -- you cursed brat!  
Look what you've done!  
I'm melting! Melting!  
Oh - what a world -- what a world!  
Who would have thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness!?  
Ohhh! Look out! Look out! I'm going.

OZ'S VOICE

Dorothy
I brought the broomstick.
Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her.
Oh ....

OZ'S VOICE ...you liquidated her, eh?   Very...
Dorothy smiling, with the Tin Man, Lion and the Scarecrow in back of her also looking pleased -- she speaks -- they react as Oz speaks --

OZ'S VOICE resourceful!
DOROTHY  
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your  
promise to us, if you please, sir.

OZ'S VOICE  
Not so fast! Not.... MLS -- Throne --  

OZ'S VOICE  
...so fast! I'll have to give the matter
Tomorrow?  
Oh, but I want to go home now.
TIN MAN  
You've had plenty of time already!

LION  
Yeah!

MLS -- Throne --

OZ'S VOICE  
Do not arouse the wrath....
OZ'S VOICE  
...of the Great and Powerful Oz! I said - come back tomorrow!

Dorothy  
(looking off-screen to the right)  
I don't want to come back tomorrow.
Toto ran in the b.g. -- it shakes as Toto starts to pull it back --

DOROTHY If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
OZ'S VOICE Do you presume to criticize the....
Great Oz? You ungrateful creatures!

Think yourselves lucky that I'm....
OZ'S VOICE ...giving you audience tomorrow, instead of....
and sees that the curtain is gone -- reacts and turns back to the controls --

OZ'S VOICE ...twenty years from now. Oh -- oh oh!
The Great Oz has spoken! Oh -- Oh ---
Oh .... Oh ....

Who are you?
Oh - I - Pay no...
OZ'S VOICE ...attention to that man behind the curtain. Go - before I lose my temper!
Dorothy questions him  
the Wizard starts to speak into the microphone  
then turns weakly back to Dorothy  
OZ'S VOICE
Who are you?

I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
You are?  

Uhhhh -- yes...

I don't believe you!  

No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no
You humbug!
Yeah!
WIZARD  
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so. I'm  
a humbug!

DOROTHY  
Oh ....
DOROTHY  
...you're a very bad man!

WIZARD  
Oh, no, my dear -- I'm -- I'm a very good man. I'm just a very bad Wizard.
You'd better be good enough to send
Dorothy back to Kansas!
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me.  
I'll - I'll do anything you say, only...  
only if you don't shout at me. It makes  
me nervous!  

It makes you nervous?
Yes.

What about us?
Well, I --

SCARECROW
What about the heart that you promised
Tin Man --?
WIZARD Well, I --

SCARECROW -- And the courage that you promised  
Cowardly Lion?
Well, I --
but you've got them. You've had them all the...
Oh, no we haven't!

You don't get around us that easy!

Not nohow!
You promised us real things -- a real...

SCARECROW
...brain!
TIN MAN o.s. A real heart!

REAL COURAGE. That's what we want.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has a brain!
From the rock-bound coast of Maine to the Sun.... oh - oh, no -- -- ah - Well, be that as it may. Back where I come from we have universities, seats of great learning -- where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts -- and with no more brains than you have....
one thing you haven't got! A diploma!

MS -- The Wizard reaches back and obtains several diplomas --
selecting one and presents it to the Scarecrow as Dorothy,
Tin Man and the Lion look on --

WIZARD Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby
Th.D.?

Yeah -- that...that's Dr. of Thinkology!
The Scarecrow recites the Pythagoras Theorem -- reacts with joy --
The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Oh joy, rapture! I've got a brain!
How can I ever thank you enough?  
The Wizard takes the Lion and leads him forward –  
CAMERA TRUCKS back and PANS right – the others follow –  
the Wizard pauses on the throne steps – opens a door and takes out a black bag – takes a medal from the bag –
Well, you can't.  
As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  
You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  
You're confusing courage with wisdom.  
Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  
Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the
And they have no more courage than you have. But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal! Therefore -- for meritorious....  

MCU -- Lion -- shooting past the Wizard in the f.g. as he presents the medal to the beaming Lion --  

WIZARD conduct, extraordinary valor,
You are now a member of the Legion of Courage!
The Wizard leans forward and kisses the Lion -- the Lion reacts, speaks --

Oh -- Oh -- shucks, folks, I'm speechless!
MS -- Dorothy, Tin Man, Scarecrow watch the Lion as he beams  
with joy over his new medal -- 

WIZARD As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky
Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.  
I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.  

TIN MAN  
But I still want one.
back where I come from there are men  
who do nothing all day but good deeds.  
They are called phil...er -- er -- phil --  
er, yes...good-deed-doers. And their
hearts are no bigger than yours. But!

They have one thing you haven't got! A testimonial!
Therefore, in consideration of your kindness, I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend....

MCU -- Wizard -- shooting past the Tin Man in left f.g.

WIZARD that a heart is not judged by how much
you love, but by how much you are loved  
by others.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks! Listen!

Yes...!

Tin Man, Lion, Dorothy react as the Tin Man shows
the watch -- the Wizard smiles as he watches them --

Lion points to his medal --

DOROTHY  
...yes.

TIN MAN  
Look -- it ticks!
read what my medal says.

Courage!

Courage!...
Ain't it the truth!  
Ain't it the truth!  
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
Hey -- what about Dorothy?

Yes -- how about Dorothy?

Yeah.

Ah --
LION: Dorothy next!
WIZARD  
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor -- CU --

DOROTHY  
Oh, I don't think there's anything in  
that black bag for me.
The Wizard protests - mumbles as he starts to look into the bag -

WIZARD  
Well, no - no -- on the contrary, on the - --- ....

The Wizard rummages through the bag as Dorothy and the others look on -- he finds nothing, so he speaks
encouragingly of what he'll do - CAMERA TRUCKS forward slightly -

WIZARD
...I -- ah -- on the contr -- -- Here --
Well, you force me into a cataclysmic
decision. The only way to get Dorothy
back to Kansas is for me to take her
there myself!

CU -- Dorothy reacts, speaks --
Oh, will you? Could you? Oh -- but are you a clever enough Wizard... to manage it?

Child -- you cut me to the quick! I'm an
Dorothy is pleased -- looks about at the others --

WIZARD o.s. ...bred in the heart of the western wilderness --

Premier balloonist par....
performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before
attempted by civilized man, an
unfortunate phenomena occurred. The
balloon failed to return to the fair.
It did?

Yes. There was I, floating through space -
Weren't you frightened?
Frightened? You are talking to a man who  
has laughed in the face of death --  
sneered at doom and chuckled at  
catastrophe. I was petrified. Then  
suddenly the wind changed, and the  
balloon floated down into the heart of  
this noble city, where I was instantly
Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!

DOROTHY  
Ohhh!

WIZARD  
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.
(laughs)
And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you  
and I will return to the land of E  
Pluribus Unum!
Good people of Oz, this is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown --

(stammers)
yes  
well  
be that as it may  
I, your Wizard par ardua ad alta, am about to embark upon a hazardous and technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere.  

MCS -- Wizard and Dorothy in the basket -- the Wizard speaks to the crowd o.s. -- CAMERA PANS to left to enter the Tin Man
Scarecrow  
Then PANS right as the Wizard points to the Lion --

Toto in Dorothy's arms -- he barks at something o.s.  
People cheer o.s.  
WIZARD o.s. Thank you.

MCS -- Dorothy in basket of balloon -- Toto jumps from her arms --  
she reacts, starts to climb out --  
MLS -- Tin Man
DOROTHY Oh, come back here! Toto!
Come back!  
Oh, don't go without me! I'll  
be right back!  
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure!

This is absolutely unprecedented!
The balloon's going up!

Help me!
Oz people wave goodbye -- the balloon exits to left f.g.

WIZARD Ruined my exit!

TIN MAN Help!

DOROTHY Oh! Come back! Don't go without me!
I can't come back!  
I don't know how it works!

Oh --
Goodbye, folks!

Goodbye!  
Goodbye!
Oh, now I'll never get home!

Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love  
you. We don't want you to go.

Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this  
could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em  
must have stopped wondering what happened
Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?

Look -- here's someone who can help you!
MS -- A group of Oz men react as they look up o.s. -- they bow out of the scene -- suddenly Glinda appears in the scene -- 

Dorothy speaks with Glinda -- 

The CAMERA TRUCKS back to left over heads of the bowing Oz people as she moves down the steps and up onto the platform to Dorothy, Tin Man, Lion and Scarecrow -- 

CS -- Dorothy, Glinda and Scarecrow on the platform -- 

Tin Man and Lion enter as the CAMERA PULLS back.
DOROTHY  
Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?

GLINDA  
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
I have?

Then why didn't you tell her before?

Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.
TIN MAN  
What have you learned, Dorothy?

DOROTHY  
Well, I -- I think that it -- that it  
wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle  
Henry and Auntie Em -- and it's that --  
if I ever go looking for my heart's
desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with! Is that right?

GLINDA points down to Dorothy's slippers
That's all it is!

But that's so easy! I should have thought of it for you.
I should have felt it in my heart.

She had to find it out for herself.
Now, those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds!
Oh....
reacts, speaks – turns about – begins to cry as she realizes she will lose her three friends
she wipes his tears away – gives him his oil can and then kisses him
goodbye to the Lion
Toto, too?

Toto, too.
Oh, now?

Whenever you wish.

Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry.
You'll rust so dreadfully. Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.

Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.

Oh -- Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the
you found your courage.

I would never've found it if it
hadn't been for you.
I think I'll miss you most of all.

Are you ready now?
Say goodbye, Toto.

DOROTHY  
Yes, I'm ready now.

GLINDA  
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels.
GLINDA  
And think to yourself -- "There's no

DOROTHY  
There's no place like home.  

GLINDA  
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.  
There's no place like home.  
There's no place like home.  
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

Aunt Em's hands enter

Yes, darling.

Hello, there! Anybody home? I -- I just dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big -- Well....

her head(hand) -- CAMERA TRUCKS back -- 

Zeke and others standing at right --
She got quite a bump on the head -- we kinda thought there for a minute she was going to leave us.

Oh --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry --  
that's just the trouble. And I tried to  
get back for days and days.

There, there, lie quiet now. You just  
had a bad dream.
Sure -- remember me -- your old pal,
Hunk?

And me -- Hickory?
You couldn't forget my face, could you?

DOROTHY  
No. But it wasn't a dream -- it was a place. And you -- and you -- and you -- and you were there.

PROFESSOR  
Oh --  
(others laugh)
But you couldn't have been, could you?

Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we

No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly
And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
DOROTHY  
...but most of it was beautiful. But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, I want to go home. And they sent me home.

MLS -- Dorothy lying in bed -- Aunt Em sitting by her -- Professor at window -- Uncle Henry -- Zeke -- Hunk
Hickory standing by -- they laugh -- Toto jumps up on to bed -

DOROTHY  
Doesn't anybody believe me?

UNCLE HENRY  
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.
Oh, but anyway, Toto, we're home!

DOROTHY Home! And this is my room -- and you're all here! And I'm not going to leave
here ever, ever again, because I love you all!  
And -- Oh, Auntie Em -- there's no place like home!
