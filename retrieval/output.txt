She isn't coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on - we'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.
Aunt Em!
Dorothy!
AUNT EM
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Dorothy, please! We're trying to count!
Fifty-eight--
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --  

Don't bother us now, honey -- this old incubator's gone bad, and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh, but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the back with a rake just because she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat every day.

Seventy --     Dorothy, please!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --

Dorothy!     Dorothy!   We're busy!

Oh -- all right.

Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.

I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.

Yes.

How's she coming?

Take it easy.

CS -- Hunk on ground -- gets finger caught under wagon bed --
Ow! You got my finger!  

Well, why don't you get your finger out of the way!  

Come on - come on - over this way.  

Okay.  

Hickory, come on over this way.  

Hunk hits his finger with hammer -- whirls around --
Right on my finger!

It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss
Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old
cat --

Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your
head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't
have any brains at all.

I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them? When you  
come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's  
place. Then Toto won't get in her  
garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  
See?

Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's  
all.

Well, your head ain't made of straw, you  
know.
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are  
rusted.  

Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.  

Well, gee, I try and have a heart.  

Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.  

This?  

Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine?
what it'll mean to this section of the country?  
I'll show you. It works perfectly now.  
Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents --  

Oh, stop it!  

DOROTHY  
Oh!  

HICKORY  
Who did it? Now wait a minute.  

DOROTHY  
Hickory!  

HICKORY  
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Say! Get in there before I make a dime bank out of you! Listen, kid, are you going to let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?

She ain't nothing to be afraid of. Have a little courage, that's all.

I'm not afraid of her.
Oh!
Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here! Help!

Are you all right, Dorothy?

Yes, I'm all right. Oh -- I fell in and - and Zeke --

Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
What's the matter -- gonna let a little  
old pig make a coward out of you?

Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white  

Here, here, what's all this jabber-  
wapping when there's work to be done? I  
know three shiftless farm hands that'll  
be out of a job before they know it!

Well, Dorothy was walking along the  

I saw you tinkering with that  
contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk  
get back to that wagon!

All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day  
they're going to erect a statue to me in
Well, don't start posing for it now.  
Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.  
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.  
Just fried.  
Thanks.
Swell.

You see, Dorothy toppled in with the big
Duroc...

It's no place for Dorothy about a pig
sty! Now you go feed those hogs before
they worry themselves into anemia!

Yes'am.

Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss
Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? She
said she was gonna --

Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining
things. You always get yourself into a
fret over nothing.
Some place where there isn't any trouble.
Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away -- behind the moon -- beyond the rain --

Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high,  
There's a land that I heard of once in a  
lullaby.

Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue, And the dreams that you dare to dream really do.... come true....

Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
Away above the chimney  
tops,  
That's where you'll find me.  
Somewhere, over the  
rainbow, bluebirds fly.  
Birds fly over the rainbow,  
Why then - oh, why can't I?  
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Beyond the  
rainbow  
Why, oh, why can't I?  

MISS GULCH  
Mr. Gale!  

UNCLE HENRY  
Howdy, Miss Gulch.  

MISS GULCH  
I want to see you and your wife right  
away....
MISS GULCH (CONT'D) ... about Dorothy.

UNCLE HENRY
Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?

MISS GULCH
What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!

UNCLE HENRY
You mean she bit you?

MISS GULCH
No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

NO!

Dorothy screams at Miss Gulch -- Miss Gulch tries to take
Toto away from Dorothy -- Uncle Henry takes Toto -- puts him
into basket --

That dog's a menace to the community.
I'm taking him to the sheriff and make
sure he's destroyed.
Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?

UNCLE HENRY  
Of course we won't. Will we, Em?

DOROTHY  
Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn't mean to. He didn't know he was doing anything wrong. I'm the one that ought to be punished. I let him go in her garden. You can send me to bed without supper --

MISS GULCH  
If you don't hand over that dog, I'll bring a damage suit that'll take your
There's a law protecting folks against dogs that bite!

How would it be if she keeps him tied up?
He's really gentle -- with gentle people,
that is.

Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide.
Here's his order allowing me to take him.
Unless you want to go against the law.

Uhh -- yeah --

Now, we can't go against the law,
Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have
to go.

Now you're seeing reason.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he  
can't attack me again.

Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him!  
You go away, you....! Oooh, I'll bite you myself!

Dorothy!

You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  
Don't let her take him -- please!
Here! I've got an order! Let me have...

Stop her!

Put him in the basket, Henry.

The idea!

Oh, don't, Uncle Henry. Oh, Toto! Don't...

Aunt Em
Almira Gulch, just because you own half
Toto, darling! Oh, I got you back!  
You
came back! Oh, I'm so glad! Toto!
Oh, they'll be coming back for you in a minute. We've got to get away! We've got to run away -- quick!
Well, well, well -- house guests, huh?
And who might you be? No, no -- now
don't tell me.

Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling
in disguise. No, that's not right. I -- you're -- you're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.

DOROTHY
How did you guess?

PROFESSOR
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
they don't understand you at home. They  
don't appreciate you. You want to see  
other lands -- big cities -- big  
mountains -- big oceans --

DOROTHY  
Why, it's just like you could read what  
was inside of me.

PROFESSOR  
Yes --

DOROTHY  
Please, Professor, why can't we go along  
with you?

DOROTHY (CONT'D)  
...polite!  
We haven't been asked yet.
He's perfectly welcome. As one dog to  
another, huh? Here now -- let's see where  
were we?

Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home,  
huh?

Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.

Oh --
Nobody cares about me at home. They  
wouldn't even miss me.

Aw, come, come, come --

No, they won't - honestly.

Oh --

Auntie Em was even going to let them kill  
Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh,  
please, Professor, why can't we go with  
you and see all the Crowned Heads of  
Europe?
Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing -  
Yes, well, I -- I never do anything  
without consulting my crystal first.  

...go inside here -- we'll -- Just come  
along. I'll show you. There you are -  
right in there.  

That's right. Here -- sit right down  
here. That's it. Ha ha! This -- this is  
the same genuine, magic, authentic  
crystal used by the Priests of Isis and
you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment -- in order to be
better in tune with the infinite. We --
we can't do these things without....
reaching out into the....
Yes.
...infinite.
That's -- that's all right. Now you can open them. We'll gaze into the crystal.
Ahh -- what's this I see? A house -- with a picket fence....
...and a barn -- with a weather vane and a -- of a -- of a running horse.
No - it's - it's - a crowing rooster.
That's our farm!
Oh -- yes.

Yes, there's -- there's a woman --
she's.... 

Yes, she's wearing a polka-dot dress....
Yes...That's Aunt Em.

Her -- her name is Emily.

That's right. What's she doing?

Well, I -- I can't quite see.   Why, she's crying.

Oh --

Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?

I had the measles once -- and she stayed
right by me every minute.

What's she doing now?
Has it poppies on the wall....  
Paper?
I said it had poppies on the wall paper!

Eh -- she's -- What's this? Why, she's --
she's putting her hand on her heart --
she's -- she's dropping down on the....

Oh, no -- no!

That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.

Oh, you....

Oh, no -- no!
you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you?  
Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!  

DOROTHY  
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right...
DOROTHY (CONT'D) away! Come on, Toto! Oh, what'll I do?

If we go home, they'll send you to the
Sheriff. And if we don't, Aunt Em may --
well, she may die! I know what I'll do -
I'll give you to Hunk. He'll watch out
for you. But we've got to hurry. Goodbye,
Professor Marvel -- and thanks a lot!

PROFESSOR Better get under cover, Sylvester --
there's a storm blowing up -- a whopper,
to speak in the vernacular of the
peasantry. Poor little kid -- I hope she
gets home all right.
Hunk, get them horses loose! Where's Hickory. Hickory! Hickory! Doggone it! Hick--

HICKORY o.s. Right here.

UNCLE HENRY (CONT'D)
Hey, what are you doing there?

HICKORY
This is my chance! The cyclone is coming. Let me show you what my machine can do! You see, it goes --
Doggone you! Help Hunk get them horses loose!

All right - you'll be sorry.

Go on, hurry up! Hurry up, I tell you!

She's here -- it's a twister!

Aunt Em runs out of house -- cups hands to her mouth -- calls o.s. -- runs to b.g. to corner of house -- calls o.s.
AUNT EM  
Henry! Henry! I can't find Dorothy! She's somewhere out in the storm! Dorothy!  

AUNT EM  
Dorothy!
Auntie Em! Auntie Em!
We're not on the ground, Toto!

Toto – I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
We must be over the rainbow!

Now I -- I know we're not in Kansas.

Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?

Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all.
I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Oh! Well....

Who, Toto?

Toto's my dog.

Well, I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch...
And there's the  
house, and here you are, and that's all...

that's left of the Wicked  
Witch of the East.

Oh, but I've already told you, I'm not a  
witch at all – witches are old and ugly. What was that?
The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

MCU -- Dorothy looks to l.f.g. -- reacts -- speaks -- curtsies --

CONTINUED: (11)

DOROTHY  
You are! Oh, I beg your pardon! But I've never heard of a beautiful... witch before.

MCU -- Glinda looks to r.f.g. and speaks --

DOROTHY o.s.
Only bad witches are ugly.

The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.

Oh. But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?

The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear. It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
(sings)
Come out, come out, wherever you are  
And meet the young lady who fell from a star.

(sings)
She fell from the sky, she fell very far.  
And Kansas she says is the name of the star.

(sing)
Kansas she says is the name of the star.
GLINDA  
(sings)  
She brings you good news.   Or haven't you heard?

When she fell out of Kansas, a miracle occurred.

DOROTHY  
(sings)  
It really was no miracle.   What happened  
was just this:

The wind began to switch – the house to pitch  
And suddenly the hinges started to unhitch.  
Just then, the witch – to satisfy an itch –  
Went flying on her broomstick thumbing for...

DOROTHY o.s.  
(sings)  
...a hitch.
And oh, what happened then was rich!

The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch

It landed on the Wicked Witch In the middle of a ditch Which was not a healthy situation For the Wicked Witch.

The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch It landed on the Wicked Witch in the middle of a ditch

The Wicked Witch, Who Began to twitch And was
reduced To just a stitch Of what was once....

...The Wicked....
We thank you very sweetly For doing it so neatly.

You've killed her so completely That we thank you very sweetly.

Is morally, ethic'ly

Spiritually, physically

Positively, absolutely
As Coroner, I must aver I thoroughly examined her. And she's not only merely dead, She's really, most sincerely dead.

Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.

The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

Ding Dong! The Witch is dead. Which old witch?

The Wicked Witch!

In the hall of fame!
I thought you said she was dead.

That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch
of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of
the West. And she's worse than the other
one was.

Who killed my sister? Who killed the
Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!

Leave her alone!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,...

Didn't you?

No -- No! It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!...

Really I didn't!
Didn't mean it, eh? Accident, eh? Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too -- and this is how I do it!

The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!

The Witch reacts as she looks down -- then turns, looks back to o.s. f.g. -- speaks --

The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
The ruby slippers! What have you done  
with them? Give them back to me, or I'll -  

It's too late! There they....  

...are, and there they'll stay!  

Dorothy reacts as she looks down  
-- gasps as she looks at the Witch o.s., then up at Glinda --
Oh!

I'm the only one that knows how to use them. They're of no use to you! Give them back to me!

Keep tight inside of them -- their magic must be very powerful, or she wouldn't want them so badly!

Give them back!

Glinda laughs, speaks -- the Witch reacts, looks up -- then continues to threaten Dorothy --
Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.

Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....

-- just try! I'll get you, my...
WITCH o.s. ...pretty, and your little dog, too! (laughs)

GLINDA
It's all right. You can get up -- she's gone.

GLINDA
It's all right. You can all get up.

GLINDA
It's all right. You can get up -- she's gone.

GLINDA
It's all right. You can all get up.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur! I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came.

No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!

The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?

No, I'm afraid I didn't.

Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
But -- what happens if I --- 

Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

Oh -- 

Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

Dorothy

Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
Now which way do we go?

That way is a very nice way.

Who said that?
DOROTHY  
Don't be silly, Toto. Scarecrows....

SCARECROW  
It's pleasant down that way, too.

DOROTHY  
...don't talk.

SCARECROW  
Of course, people do....

DOROTHY  
That's funny. Wasn't he pointing the  
other way?
go both ways!

Why...
Are you doing that on purpose, or can't  
you make up your mind?

I can't make up my mind. I haven't got a brain -- only  
straw.

How can you talk if you haven't got a....?

...brain?
But some people without  
brains do an awful lot of talking, don't  
they?

Yes, I guess you're right.

Well, we haven't really met properly,
have we?

Why, no.
Dorothy  
How do you do?

Scarecrow  
How do you do?

Dorothy  
Very well, thank you.

Scarecrow  
Oh, I'm not feeling at all well. You see, it's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your...
Oh, dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

Down?   No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --

Oh, well, here -- let me help you.

Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.

Well, oh, dear -- I don't quite see....
Of course, I'm not bright about doing  
things, but if you'll just...

bend the nail down in the back, maybe I'll  
slip off and...

Oh....

yes.
Ohhhh --

Ohh!

Whhhooops!     Ha-ha -- there goes some of
me again!

Oh -- does it hurt you?

Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and
putting it back in again.
My, it's good to be.... free!

Dorothy screams as the Scarecrow whirls about and falls over the cornfield fence -- she rushes to him -- the CAMERA TRUCKS forward as she kneels beside him -- they speak -

SCARECROW
Did I scare you?
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt  
yourself.

But I didn't scare you?

No -- of course not.

I didn't think so.

O.S. Boo! Scat!
Boo! You see, I can't even scare a crow! They come from miles.... around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face! Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got  
a brain.

Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could --  
I could while away the hours, Conferrin'  
with the flowers, Consultin' with the rain. And my head I'd be scratchin' While my thoughts were busy hatchin' If I only had a brain. I'd unravel every riddle For any individ'le

Dorothy reacts,  
Camera Trucks forward as he dances back up the Yellow Brick Road – then Pulls back as he comes forward to Dorothy again – he dances to left to the cornfield – Camera Pans left – he falls over the fence, then rolls back under it as Dorothy rushes to help him – he reacts, sits on the curb of the road –
Life would be a ding-a-derry If I only  
had a brain!

reason out the reason For things I can't

And be even worthy erv you If I only had  
a brain.

DOROTHY  
Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in  
Kansas could do that, the crows'd be
scared to pieces!

SCARECROW  
They would?

DOROTHY  
Um-hmm.

SCARECROW  
Where's Kansas?

DOROTHY  
That's where I live. And I want to get  
back there so badly I'm going all the way  
to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz  
to help me.

You're going to see a Wizard?

DOROTHY  
Um-hmm.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?

I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.

Yes -- that's true.

But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.

Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch!
I don't blame you for that.

Why, of course I will!

Look - I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think. Won't you take me with you?
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!

DOROTHY  
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out  
very well.

SCARECROW  
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.

DOROTHY  
To Oz?

SCARECROW  
To Oz!

We've been walking a long ways and I was hungry and -- Did you say....  
She....  

What do you think you're doing?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.

Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples. Hmm!

What do you mean - she doesn't want any of those apples? Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be?
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green....

SCARECROW o.s. ...worms!

TREE
Oh....

SCARECROW
Go -- Go!

TREE
...Oh -- Help -- let me out.   I'll give you little green....

Dorothy
(not spoken)

SCARECROW
(backs in from left f.g.)
(not spoken)
I'll show you how to get apples.  
You can't....  
...do that to me!     I'll....  
...show you!
You can't do that!  
You can't do that!
Hey!

Hooray!  
Oh --

Help yourself.

Oh --

Hooray! I guess that did it!  

Tin foot -- reacts -- examines it --

standing up by the Tin Man -- Scarecrow comes in from left -- examine him -- he tries to speak --
A man made out of tin!

What?

Oil can.....Oil can....
Oil can....

Oil can what?

Oh -- oh, here it is!

Where do you want to be oiled first?

My mouth -- my mouth!

He said his mouth.

Here -- here --
Yes --- there.

Mm.....mm...mm....

...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I  
can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please  
-- oil my elbows.

Oh...
Dorothy  
...Oh, did that hurt?

Tin Man  
No -- it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Oh ---

Dorothy  
Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was  
chopping that tree -- minding my own  
business -- when suddenly it started to  
rain....

...and right in the middle of a chop,  
I...I rusted solid. And I've been that  
way ever since.

My...my neck. My...my neck. Perfect?  
Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm  
perfect. Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh --!

Beautiful! What an echo!

It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give  
me a heart.

No heart?

No heart.

Oh --!
When a man's an empty kettle, He should  
be on his mettle. And yet I'm torn apart. Just because I'm presumin' That I could  
be kind-a human, If I only had a heart.

I'd be tender -- I'd be gentle And awful  
sentimental Regarding Love and Art I'd be  
friends with sparrows...
(sings) ...And the boy who shoots the arrows If I  
only had a heart. Picture me....a  
balcony....Above a voice sings low.

SNOW WHITE'S VOICE

Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

TIN MAN  
I hear a beat....how sweet! Just to  
register emotion Jealousy -- Devotion --  
And really feel the part, I could stay  
young and chipper, And I'd lock it with a  
zipper, If I only had a heart...!
Dorothy oils it.

Dorothy whispers to the Scarecrow.

Dorothy grabs the Tin Man's hand.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?

I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

Oh, dear -- That was wonderful! You know -- we were just wondering why you  
couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.

Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.

And I'll keep the oil-can handy.

Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?

Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.
(Witch laughs o.s.)
You call that long?

Why, you've just begun! Forgotten about
me,...

Helping the little lady along, are you,
my fine gentlemen?

Well, I haven't forgotten about you!

Well, stay away from her!
WITCH  
Want to play ball?

WITCH  
And as for you, my little....
WITCH o.s. ...Dorothy, I wish....  
WITCH o.s. ...you luck with the Wizard of Oz. And a....  
WITCH o.s. ...happy journey back to Kansas!  

SCARECROW  
I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get  
safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a  
brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not. Bee-hive -- bah!

Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me!

Oh! They're - they're gone now.

Did any of them sting you?

I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a  
whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's  
one on me!

Oh - I'll get it!

Oh! Oh!

Oh --

Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that  
poor little honey bee!
Oh-oh-

It's only a man without a head who could do a thing like that. Poor little bee.

Oh, there....

There. Don't cry.

As a matter of fact, that's just an old drone bee, and it would have died....
Yes?

It's....
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand  
by and let her get away with fireballs  
and bees, do you?

No, sir!

No, sir!

Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever  
had! And it's funny, but I feel as if  
I've known you all the time. But I  
couldn't have, could I?

I don't see how. You weren't around when  
I was stuffed and sewn together, were  
you?

And I was standing over there rusting for  
the longest time.
Still, I wish I could remember. But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we?

That's right.

We do.

To Oz?

To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard  
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  
We hear he is a whiz of a  
Wiz If ever a Wiz there was.  
If ever, oh ever a Wiz there was  
The Wizard of Oz is one because  
Because, because, because, because, because  
Because of the wonderful things he does  
We're off to see the Wizard  
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz!

Dorothy frightened -- speaks --
I don't like this forest! It's -- it's dark and creepy!

Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?

We might.

Oh --

Animals that -- that eat straw?

Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Lions?

And tigers?

And bears.
Oh! Lions and tigers and bears!

Oh, my!

Lions and tigers and bears!

Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!

Oh, my!

Oh, my!
(screams)
And bears!

What sort of an animal is that?

It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!

D-d-d-don't be fr-fr-frightened. I - I'll
- I'll protect you. Oh, look!
Put 'em up! Put 'em....

Which one of you first? I'll fight you both together if you want!

I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back. I'll fight you standing on one foot.

I'll fight you with my eyes closed. Oh -- pulling an axe on me, eh?
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why!  
(snarls)

Go 'way and let us alone!

Oh, scared, huh?

Afraid, huh?

How long can you stay fresh in that can?  
(laughs)
Come on -- get up and fight, you shivering junk yard!  
Put your hands up, you lop-sided bag of hay!

Now that's getting personal, Lion.

Yes -- get up and teach him a lesson.

Well -- what's -- wrong with you teaching him?

Well -- well --, I hardly know him.

CS -- Scarecrow reacts -- speaks --

SCARECROW
Now that's getting personal, Lion.

MCU -- Tin Man looks o.s. -- speaks --

TIN MAN
Yes -- get up and teach him a lesson.

MCS -- Scarecrow and Lion -- Dorothy in b.g. -

SCARECROW
Well -- what's -- wrong with you teaching him?

MCU -- Tin Man reacts -- speaks --

TIN MAN
Well -- well --, I hardly know him.

CS -- Toto barking -- CU -- Lion snarls --
LION  
Shame on you!
What -- what did you do that for? I didn't bite him.

No, but you tried to.

It's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --

Well, you didn't have to go and hit me,
did you? Is my nose bleeding?

Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally,  
when you go around picking on things
You're right -- I am a coward.

I haven't any courage at all. I even scare myself. Look at the circles under my eyes.
I haven't slept in weeks.

Why don't you try counting sheep?

That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.

Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?

I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.

And him a brain.

I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Well, wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion?

I would.

No, of course not.

Gee, that's -- that's awfully nice of you. My life....

...has been simply unbearable.
Oh.

Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When  
you're born to be a sissy, Without the  
vim and verve. But I could show my  
prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If  
I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's  
no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A  
fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a  
blizzard --

I'd be gentle as a lizard --
I'd be clever as a gizzard --

If the Wizard is a Wizard who will serve.

Then I'm sure to get a brain --

A heart --

A home --

The nerve.
Oh, we're off to see the Wizard  
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. We hear he is a  
whiz of a Wiz If ever a Wiz there was...

...If ever, oh ever, a Wiz there was The  
Wizard of Oz is one because Because, because, because, because, because  
Because of the wonderful things he does!
A-hah!  
(laughs)  
So! You won't take warning, eh? All the worse for you, then. I'll take care of you now instead of later! Hah!  
When I gain those ruby slippers, my power will be the greatest in Oz! And now, my beauties! Something with poison in it, I think. With poison in it, but attractive to the eye -- and soothing to the smell!  
(laughs)  
Poppies! Poppies! Poppies!
There's Emerald...

City! Oh, we're almost there at last!
At last!
It's beautiful, isn't it? Just like I knew it would be. He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!

Well, come on, then. What are we waiting for?

Nothing! Let's hurry!

Yes -- let's run!

Yes.
Come on -- come on --
Hurry -- hurry --
Oh!    Oh, come on, come on!
Look -- you can see it here.    It's wonderful!
Emerald City!

Oh -- Oh -- what's happening? What is it?

I can't run anymore. I'm so.... sleepy.
Oh, no -- please. I have to rest for  
just a minute. Toto!

Oh, you can't rest now -- we're nearly  
there!

What did she -- do that for?
SCARECROW  
Hey, Dorothy!

TIN MAN  
Dorothy!

LION  
Dorothy!
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!

WITCH  
(laughs)  
Call away! Call away! She won't hear any of you again! And there's nothing you can do about it, either.  
(laughs)  

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

MLS -- Lion -- Tin Man and Scarecrow -- Dorothy lying in poppies -- Lion starts to cry -- Scarecrow speaks -- holds the Lion up -- Lion drops as Tin Man and Scarecrow start to pick up Dorothy --

TIN MAN  
(crying)  
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!

Comin' to think of it, forty winks
wouldn't be bad.

Don't you start it, too!

Oh! We ought to try and carry Dorothy.

I don't think I could, but we could try.

Let's.

Yes.

Oh -- now look at him! This is terrible!
SCARECROW  
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her  
an inch! This is a spell, this is!

TIN MAN  
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?  
Help! HELP!
HELP -- HELP!

Look - It's snowing! It isn't snowing. It couldn't be! But it is! No, it isn't! Yes, it is! Oh, maybe that'll help!

Oh, but it couldn't help.

she wakens -- sits up -- 

Dorothy looks o.s. to left -- 

she opens her eyes --

Lion sits up in b.g. -- 

Dorothy jumps up -- 

takes oil can from basket -- 

they oil the Tin Man --
It does help. Dorothy, you're waking up!

Oh --

Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?

Look! He's rusted again. Oh, give me the oil can -- quick! Oh-oh, quick!
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him  
up.

A hot water bottle would be good if we  
had one.

Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --

Curse it! Curse it! Somebody always helps  
that girl! But shoes or no shoes, I'm still  
great enough to conquer her. And woe to  
those who try to stop me!
Come on -- let's get out of here! Look --
Emerald City is closer and prettier than
ever!

You're out of the woods You're out of the dark
You're out of the night Step into the sun Step into the light
Keep straight ahead for....
The most glorious place --

To the Emerald City -- as fast as
lightning!

To the Emerald City --
Of the earth or the sky  
Hold onto your breath  
Hold onto your heart  
Hold onto your hope  

March up to the gate And bid it open --- open --- open.

Who rang that bell?

We did.

Can't you read?

Read what?
The notice!

What notice?

"Bell out of order.   Please knock."
Well, that's more like it. Now, state your business!

The Wizard? But nobody can see the Great Oz! Nobody's ever seen the Great Oz! Even I've never seen him!

Oh, then -- how do you know there is one?

Because he -- I -- Oh, you're wasting my time!

Oh, please! Please....
sir. I've got to see the Wizard! The  
Good Witch of the North sent me!  

Prove it.  

She's wearing the ruby slippers she gave  
her.  

Oh....
so she is! Well, bust my buttons!

Why didn't you say that in the.... CS --

Dorothy -- Tin Man and Lion smiling --

...first place? That's a horse.... CU --

DOORMAN o.s. -- speaks -- exits -- closing window --

Cabby! Cabby! Just what you're looking
for! Take you any place in the City, we

DOROTHY
The Wizard? The Wizard? I -- can't --

Well -- Yes, of course. But first I'll take you to a little place where you can....

Dorothy -- Oh, thank you so much. We've been gone such a long time, and we feel so mess --

What kind of a horse is that? I've never seen a horse like that before!
No -- and never will again, I fancy.

There's only one of him, and he's it.

He's the Horse of a Different Color,
you've heard tell about.

DOROTHY
Oh --

OZ WOMAN
Dorothy?   Who's Dorothy?

OZ WOMAN
The Wizard will explain it!

MAN
To the Wizard!

MAN
To the Wizard!
Dear, whatever shall we do?

Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!

Dear, whatever shall we do?
Wait a minute! Stop - stop - stop! It's all right!

Every -- It's all right! Everything is all right! The Great and Powerful Oz has got matters well in hand - I hope -- So you can all go...

home -- and there's nothing to worry about.

Get out of here now -- go on! Go on home -- I - I -- go home.
If you please, sir. We want to see the Wizard right away -- all four of us.

Oh, but we must!
Orders are - not nobody! Not nohow!

He's in conference with himself on
account of this....

And even if he
wasn't you
wouldn't have been able to see
him anyway
on account of nobody has - not
even us in
the Palace!

Oh, but -- but please. It's very
important.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.

Not nobody! Not.... nohow!

Pardon me. We've gotta change the guards.
Now - what do you want?

We want to see the Wizard.

Not nobody! Not.... nohow!

That's what the other man said.

But she's Dorothy!
The Witch's Dorothy? Well -- that makes  
a difference. Just wait here -- I'll  
announce you at once.

SCARECROW  
Did you hear that? He'll announce us at  
once! I've as good as got my brain!

TIN MAN  
I can fairly hear my heart beating!

DOROTHY  
I'll be home in time for supper!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!

(sings)
If....

(sings)
...I were King of the Forest, Not Queen, not Duke, not Prince....

(sings)
My regal robes of the forest....
Would be satin, and not cotton, and not  
chintz.

I'd command each thing, be it fish or fowl.  

With a woof and a woof, and a royal  
growl. As...

I'd click my heel All the trees would  
kneel And the mountains bow And the bulls  
kowtow
I...'f -- I...were King!

Each rabbit would show respect to me.
The chipmunks...

I...'f -- I...'f -- I --- were King Just King!...  

Scarecrow, Dorothy and Tin Man in front of him - they bow,
Each rabbit would show respect to him The chipmunks genuflect to him  
And his wife would be Queen of the May.  
I'd be monarch of all I survey....  
Monarch of all I survey....
Mah -- hah -- hah -- hah -- hah -- hah --  
hah -- hah -- hah -- ha-narch!  
Of all I survey!

Not nobody, not nohow!

Not even a rhinoceros?
How about a hippopotamus?

Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!

Supposin' you met an elephant?

I'd wrap him up in cellophant!

What if it were a brontosaurus?
How?

How?

Courage!

What makes a King out of a slave? Courage!

What makes the flag on the mast to wave?
Courage!

The Guard sticks his head out of the peep window in the gates - looks o.s. to f.g. - CAMERA TRUCKS forward on him - LION o.s.

What makes the elephant charge his tusk In the misty....
What makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage!

What makes the sphinx the seventh wonder? Courage!

What makes the dawn come up like thunder? Courage!

What makes the Hottentot so hot? 

What puts the "ape" in apricot? 

What have they got that I ain't got?

Courage!
You can say that again!    Hah.   Huh!?  

Go on home! The Wizard says go away!

Go away?

Oh --

Looks like we came a long way for  
nothing.
Oh -- and I was so happy! I thought I was on my way home!

Don't cry, Dorothy!

Would...would it do any good if I roared?

Who at?
I don't know.

Auntie Em was so good to me -- and I  
never appreciated it. Running away --  
and hurting her feelings.

Professor Marvel said she was sick. She  
may be dying -- and -- and it's all my  
fault!

Oh, I'll never forgive myself! Never --  
never -- never!
Oh, oh -- please don't cry any more.
I'll get you into the Wizard somehow.
Come on. I had an Aunt Em myself once.

Wait a minute, fellahs. I was just
thinkin'. I really don't want to see the
Wizard this much. I better wait for you
outside.

What's the matter?
Oh, he's just ascared again.

Don't you know the Wizard's going to give
you some courage?

I'd be too scared to ask him for it.

Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.

I'd sooner wait outside.
But why? Why?

Because I'm still scared!

Oh, come on.

OHH!

What happened?

Somebody pulled my tail.

Oh, you did it yourself!

I -- Oh --
Here -- Come on.

What was that?

Our echo.

Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.

Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!

The Great Wizard of Oz. Come forward!

Tell me when it's over!   Oh!
Look at that! Look at that! Oh --  
Ohhhh -- I want to go home -- I want to  
go home!

I am Oz, the Great and Powerful!

The Four trembling and shaking with fear --

Who are you?

The Four react with fear -- the others shove Dorothy forward -- she comes forward, speaks --

I -- If you please, I - I am Dorothy,
the small and meek. We've come to ask you --

Silence!

Ohhh -- Jiminy Crickets!
Tin Man  
Ohhhh -- it's me!

OZ'S VOICE  
Tin Man!

OZ'S VOICE  
You dare to come to me for a heart, do you? You clinking, clanking, clattering collection of caliginous junk!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  
You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --  

Oz's Voice: Quiet!  

Oz's Voice: And you, Scarecrow, have the effrontery
You billowing bale of bovine fodder!

Y-Yes -- Yes, Your Honor -- I mean, Your
Excellency -- I -- I mean -- Your
Wizardry!

Enough!

Uh -- And you,.... 

Lion!
Oh -- Oh -- Ohhhh!

Oh -- Oh -- Oh!....

You ought to be ashamed of yourself --
frightening him like that, when he came
to you for help!
Silence!....

Whippersnapper!

The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting....

The Lion revives, sits up, speaks -- Dorothy starts to pull him up --

Your requests!
What's that? What'd he say?

Oh -- Oh, come on.

Huh?   What'd he say?

But first, you must prove yourselves worthy by performing a very small task.

Bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West.
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have  
to kill her to get it!  

OZ'S VOICE  
Bring me her broomstick, and I'll grant  
your requests.

LION  
But -- but what if she kills us first?
OZ'S VOICE said, -Go!
I'D TURN BACK IF I WERE YOU!
I'd turn back if I were you.
(growls)

From now on, we're on enemy ground. You
should have something to protect yourself
with.

She - she can have my Witch Remover.

Does it work?

No, but it's wonderful for threatening
Oh --

Oh, here - give me that thing! MLS -
Spray hits the ground - then vanishes -

Oh - look out.

You know something? MCU -- Lion and Scarecrow --

I believe they're spooks around here. MCU -- Dorothy and Tin Man --
That's ridiculous! Spooks -- that's....

...silly.

Don't you believe in spooks?

No.   Why only -- Oh --

Oh!   Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Oh -- Oh --

are you -- are you all right?

I do believe in spooks, I do believe in
spooks. I do -- I do -- I do -- I do -- I
do -- I....
spooks! I do -- I do -- I do -- I do --
I do -- I do!

WITCH  
(laughs)  
You'll believe in more than that before
I've finished with you.  

Take your army  
to the Haunted Forest, and bring me that  
girl and her dog! Do what you like with  
the others, but I want her alive and  
unharmed!

They'll give you no trouble, I promise  
you that. I've sent a little insect on  
ahead to take the fight out of them.  

Take special care of those ruby slippers.  
I want those most of all.  

Now, fly!  
Fly! Bring me that girl and her slippers!  
Fly! Fly! Fly!

Oh, come on now - everybody --

Did you just hear what I just heard?

That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.

It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
It's giving me the jitters In the joints  
around my knees.

Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy  
and he's furry I haven't got a brain But  
I think I ought to worry!

I haven't got a heart But I got a  
palpitation.

As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the  
situation.

Are you gonna stand around And let 'em
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think  
I lost my roarer.

Oh! Well, what happened to you?
They tore my legs off, and they threw  
them over there! Then they took my chest  
out, and they threw it over there!

Well, that's you all over.

They sure knocked the stuffings out of  
you, didn't they?

Don't stand there talking! Put me together!  
We've got to find Dorothy!

Now, let's see -- this goes -- Oh, I
Wish I were better at puzzles.
What a nice little dog! And you, my dear. What an unexpected pleasure!

It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.

What are you going to do with my dog?
Oh, please give me back my dog!

Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.

But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.

Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
No! No -- no! Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.

WITCH
That's a good little girl. I knew you'd see reason.

Ahh! Ah!

DOROTHY
I'm sorry. I didn't do it! Can I still have my dog?
No! Fool, that I am! I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...

...you're alive.

What are you gonna do?

What do you think I'm going to do? But that's not what's worrying me -- it's how to do it. These things must be done delicately....
Run, Toto, run!

Catch him, you fool!

Run, Toto, run!

He got away! He got away!
Ohhh! Which is more than you will!

Drat you and your dog!

You've been more trouble to me than you're worth, one way or another -- but it'll soon be over now!

Do you see that? That's how much longer you've got to be alive! And it isn't...

long, my pretty! It isn't long!

Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right.
We must worry about Dorothy.

You'll find me
What's that? What's that?

That's the castle of the Wicked Witch!
Dorothy's in that awful place!

Oh, I hate to think of her in there.
We've got to get her out.

SCARECROW  
And you're going to lead us.

LION  
Yeah. Me?  

SCARECROW  
Yes, you.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta  
there?

That's right.

All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy --  
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards  
or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  
(growls)  

I may not come out alive, but I'm going  
in there.  

There's only one thing I want you fellows  
to do.

What's that?

Talk me out of it.
Oh, no!

No?  
Now, wait a minute.

You don't neither --

Now...
I'm frightened, I'm frightened, Auntie Em

to find you. Where are you?

You put up a great fight, Lion.

Yeah --

I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Hah. I - I must have bitten you a couple of times.

Come on -- I've got another idea.

Do -- do you think it'll be polite --
dropping in like this?

Come on -- come on.
Where do we go now?  
Yeah.
Wait! We'd better make sure. Dorothy, are you in there?

It's us!

Yes, it's me! She's locked me in!
Oh, I knew you'd get here in time!

Listen, fellows. It's her. We gotta get her out! Open this door!

Please, sir. We've done what you told
We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her.

You are?

Uhhhh -- yes...

I don't believe you!
You humbug!

Yeah!

You humbug!
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.   I'm a humbug!

Oh ....

Oh, no, my dear -- I'm -- I'm a very good
man. I'm just a very bad Wizard.

You'd better be good enough to send
Dorothy back to Kansas!

You'd better be good enough to send
Dorothy back to Kansas!
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me.
I'll - I'll do anything you say, only...
only if you don't shout at me. It makes
me nervous!

It makes you nervous?

Yes.

What about us?

Well, I --

What about the heart that you promised
Tin Man --?
And the courage that you promised  
Cowardly Lion?
but you've got them. You've had them all the...

Oh, no we haven't!

You don't get around us that easy!

Not nohow!

You promised us real things -- a real...

TIN MAN o.s. A real heart!

LION
Real courage. That's what we want.

(CONTINUED)

WIZARD
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.

MS -- The Wizard speaks to Tin Man, Dorothy, Lion and the Scarecrow -- the Wizard becomes eloquent -- steps closer to
Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a
very mediocre commodity. Every
pusillanimous creature that crawls on the
earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has
a brain!

From the rock-bound coast of Maine to the
Sun.... oh - oh, no -- -- ah - Well, be
that as it may. Back where I come from we
have universities, seats of great
learning -- where men go to become great
thinkers. And when they come out, they
think deep thoughts -- and with no more
brains than you have.... But! They have
one thing you haven't got! A diploma!

The Wizard reaches back and obtains several diplomas --
selecting one and presents it to the Scarecrow as Dorothy,
Tin Man and the Lion look on --
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.

Th.D.?

Yeah -- that...that's Dr. of Thinkology!
How can I ever thank you enough?  
How can I ever thank you enough?  
You're a victim of disorganized thinking. You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.
confusing courage with wisdom.  
Back where I come from, we have men who are  
called heroes. Once a year, they take  
their fortitude out of mothballs and  
parade it down the main street of the  
city. And they have no more courage than  
you have. But! They have one thing that  
you haven't got! A medal! Therefore --  
for meritorious....

conspicuous bravery against wicked
witches, I award you the Triple Cross.

MS -- Scarecrow, Tin Man and Dorothy watching as the Wizard
presents the medal to the Lion --

WIZARD
You are now a member of the Legion of
Courage!
Oh -- Oh -- shucks, folks, I'm speechless!

As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been
But I still want one.

Yes -- ....

back where I come from there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.
They are called phil...er -- er -- phil --
er, yes...good-deed-doers. And their

They have one thing you haven't got! A

Yes...!

Look -- it ticks!

Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.

Hey -- what about Dorothy?

The only way to get Dorothy back to Kansas is for me to take her there myself!

Oh, will you? Could you? Oh -- but are you a clever enough Wizard...?

Child -- you cut me to the quick! I'm an old Kansas man myself...born and....

I...bred in the heart of the western wilderness --
excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while
performing spectacular feats of
stratospheric skill never before
attempted by civilized man, an
unfortunate phenomena occurred. The
balloon failed to return to the fair.

It did?

There was I, floating through space -
Weren't you frightened?

Frightened? You are talking to a man who
has laughed in the face of death --
sneered at doom and chuckled at
catastrophe. I was petrified. Then
suddenly the wind changed, and the
balloon floated down into the heart of
this noble city, where I was instantly
acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!

Ohhh!
Times being what they were, I accepted  
the job, -- retaining my balloon against  
the advent of a quick get-away.  

(laughs)  

And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you  
and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!  

Good people of Oz, this is positively the  
finest exhibition ever to be shown --  

(stammers)
yes  
well  
be that as it may  
I, your Wizard par ardua ad alta, am about to embark upon a hazardous and technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere.

To confer, converse, and otherwise hob-nob with my brother wizards. And I hereby decree that until what time -- if any -- that I return, the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains, shall rule in my stead... assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart... and the Lion -- by virtue of his courage! Obey them as you would me! And - ah - well, that's all.
Oh, come back here! Toto!

Come back! Oh, don't go without me! I'll be right back! Toto!

Stop that dog!
Oh!    Help me! The balloon's going up!

Ruined my exit!
Oh! Come back! Don't go without me!
Please come back!
I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
Oh --
Goodbye, folks!
Goodbye!
Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love  
you. We don't want you to go.

Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this  
could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em  
must have stopped wondering what happened  
to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I  
going to do?

Look -- here's someone who can help you!
Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?

You don't need to be helped any longer.
You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.

I have?

Then why didn't you tell her before?

Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.
What have you learned, Dorothy?

Well, I -- I think that it -- that it
wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle
Henry and Auntie Em -- and it's that --
if I ever go looking for my heart's
desire again, I won't look any further
than my own backyard. Because if
it isn't there, I never really lost it to
begin with! Is that right?

That's all it is!

But that's so easy! I should have
thought of it for you.
I should have felt it in my heart.

She had to find it out for herself.
Now, those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds!

Oh....

Oh -- Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know  
it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the  
way you used to holler for help before  
you found your courage.

Well -- I would never've found it if it  
hadn't been for you.

I think I'll miss you most of all.

Are you ready now?
Say goodbye, Toto.

DOROTHY
Yes, I'm ready now.

GLINDA
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels

DOROTHY
Yes, I'm ready now.

GLINDA
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels

Yes, I'm ready now.

There you go. And close your eyes, and tap your heels

DOROTHY
Yes, I'm ready now.

GLINDA
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels

Yes, I'm ready now.

There you go. And think to yourself -- "There's no
